# Forever Classmate development

Active source: `addons/ForeverUtilities/`. The folder, TOC filename, saved-variable name, and release tag prefix remain stable for upgrades. Version 0.19.0 ships Hunter and Shaman modules selected through the class registry in `Core.lua`.

`ClassHost.lua` owns the shared movable 400 × 56 host, lock button, scale, and position. `UI.lua` owns class-aware settings, minimap, commands, and initialization. Inactive class modules may initialize saved defaults but must not create frames, register events, or poll.

Hunter runtime:

- `TargetContext.lua` supplies facing, ammo, pet, aspect, and mark readings.
- `Range.lua` owns the Hunter display and active event/update lifecycle.
- `Distance.lua` owns Hunter defaults, migration, class registration, and lazy creation.
- Existing flat or `modules.distance` settings migrate once to `ForeverUtilitiesDB.hunter`.

Shaman runtime:

- `ShamanContext.lua` reads secret-safe totem, temporary-enchant, aura, and mana state.
- `Shaman.lua` owns Shaman discovery, its modular blocks, defaults, class registration, and event/update lifecycle.
- Shaman preferences live in `ForeverUtilitiesDB.shaman`; Hunter preferences are unchanged.

Use learned spellbook discovery and localized spell metadata. Never guess an exact timer, aura, resource, range, or specialization state when an API is absent or secret. No module may automate combat actions.

Run `python3 scripts/check.py`, `git diff --check`, and `python3 scripts/package.py`. Follow `AGENTS.md` for local installation, versioned GitHub releases, CurseForge receipts, synchronized descriptions, and file retention.

CurseForge publishing follows the [file retention policy](curseforge-retention.md). Cleanup requires the author dashboard; CI reports it as pending.
